## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues for `chenxin-yan/mitome`; external pull requests are not a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the canonical `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, and `wontfix` labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Use the single-context layout with root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Effect Best Practices

**IMPORTANT:** Always consult effect-solutions before writing Effect code.

1. Run `effect-solutions list` to see available guides
2. Run `effect-solutions show <topic>...` for relevant patterns (supports multiple topics)
3. Search `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect` for real implementations

Topics: quick-start, project-setup, tsconfig, basics, services-and-layers, data-modeling, error-handling, config, testing, cli.

Never guess at Effect patterns - check the guide first.
